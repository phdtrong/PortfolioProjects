This is the final project of IBM Certificate of Applied Data Science. This is a full data cycle project that studies about predicting risk of SPACEX landing process of: <br>
  Extract data from primary source of Space X database  <br>
    (jupyter-labs-webscrapping) <br>
  Quantitative analysis on data records based on multiple filtering factors on real-time webpage  <br>
    On Python of Seaborn and Matplotlib: (jupyter-labs-eda-dataviz) <br>
    On SQLAlchemy: (jupyter-lab-eda-sql-coursera_sqlite_bak-2023-10-09-01-06-00Z) <br>
  Quality Visualization on outcome of landing process <br>
    On Python of Dash and Folium: lab_jupyter_launch_site_location (1) <br>
  Transform data to a better dataset and prepare for predicting models <br>
    On Data normalization and feature egineering : (jupyter-lab-eda-sql-coursera_sqlite_bak-2023-10-09-01-06-00Z) <br>
  Visualization on data insight: <br>
    On Dash: spacex_dash_app_1 <br>
